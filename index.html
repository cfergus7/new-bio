            <p>I would like to consider myself a modern day renaissance man. I have been around a lot of different
                backgrounds which has made me into the person that I am today. I grew up on a farm with a wood burning
                furnace as well as small farm animals like horses and ducks.
                This element lead to a lot of different tasks like spliting and stacking wood, or waking up early in the
                morning in the winter to cut holes in the ice so the animals had fluids to drink throught the day.
                I got a growth spurt early so getting into sports only seemed natural for me. The passion was very
                intense
                and then if I had practice that day I didn't have to do as many daily tasks on the farm as well as
                getting
                to socialize with my friends after school.
                I started on two championship teams in high school earning a 2 peat and 3 peat ring in rugby. Going to
                UTK I
                continued to persue Rugby as well as Basketball at the next level. On top of this I was also a
                competitive
                gameer and traveled to events in various cities.
                After college I drifted around a bit trying to find a sense of purpose as well as trying to find a
                passion.
                I got into corprate training of hotels and resturants and traveled across the US. This lead to a ton of
                opportunities,
                moving to California was the highest risk one which left the biggest impact on my life. Living so far
                away
                from my family and friend group really forced me to become independent and figure out what truely made
                me
                happy.
                I started playing competitive beach volleyball, which has become a true passion of mine. Currently I
                train
                with 2 time olympian John Hyden helping him stay at the top of his game. Hopefully I get to say I helped
                him
                make it to the Tokyo Games.</p>
